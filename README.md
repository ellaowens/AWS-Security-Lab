In our Phase-2 group cybersecurity lab project at TKH, we embarked on an exciting journey to demonstrate our understanding and practical application of a wide range of AWS services within the AWS Cloud Environment. Collaborating closely as a team, we delved into the intricate world of cybersecurity, showcasing our knowledge, skills, and abilities across numerous AWS services:

- EC2
- IAM
- AWS Security Groups
- NACLS
- WAF
- S3
- VPC Networking, Subnetting, and Routing
- AMAZON RDS & DynamoDB
- LAMDA
- EC2 Auto Scaling Groups and Network Load Balancer
- CloudWatch
- AWS Trusted Advisor
- Amazon API Gateway

Our mission was to craft a cloud-native cybersecurity lab that encompassed various critical components:

- **Offensive Security**: We harnessed tools like Kali Linux, Parrot Security OS, BlackArch Linux, and BackBox to explore offensive security measures.

- **Defensive Security**: Our lab incorporated essential defensive measures, including firewalls, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS).

- **SIEM Tool**: To monitor and manage security events effectively, we implemented SIEM tools such as Splunk, AlienVault OSSIM, Wazuh, and SIEM Monster.

- **Exploitable Systems**: We created intentionally vulnerable systems, including Metasploitable2 and misconfigured/unpatched target machines, to gain insights into potential vulnerabilities.

- **Secure Platform**: Ensuring that our lab adhered to AWS security standards and industry best practices was paramount.

- **Complete Technical Documentation**: We meticulously documented our project, providing a comprehensive resource for understanding our setup and methodologies.

- **Cost Analysis**: Understanding the cost implications of our project was vital, and we conducted a thorough cost analysis.
